  This sime is a represntation on what a first attempt of what i want from a website.
  there are so many ideas that i want to implement.  or styles, however i do like simplicity.
  one site that i do find elegan and simple is <a href="http:www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple's website</a>
</section>

<section>
  There is also <a href="http:www.google.com" target="_blank">Google's home</a> it also has that
  simplicity.  the only diffrence between Apple and Google.  Apple is direct in
  your face selling of products.  Google is striped of that till a search is made super clean,
  and not push.  that still desn't change that Apple is still elegant.
