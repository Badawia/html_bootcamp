  <h1 id="primary">Fun At Sea Surfing</h1>

  <p>
    We’ve created in 2011 the first French surf school in California. We will
    teach all year round, in French or in English depending on your preferences!
     The classes take place in Half Moon Bay 30 minutes south of San Francisco
     where we have an official
    license, on a very safe spot (Princeton Jetty) close to famous Maverick’s.
    Trust us, you will never feel the cold water as you will enjoy some magic
     and exciting experiences: meeting seals & dolphins, using all the energy
     of your body to face the
    power of the ocean.

    he talent with which she paints, and the passion for extreme sports are
    innate in Flor de Pamphilis. Both come exceptionally natural to her. Flor,
    also known as Pampi, is a young, talented artist from Argentina who is
    trail-blazing surf ­art in South
    America. Between painting for popular brands such as Vans and Red Bull,
    Pampi gave me the wonderful opportunity to gain a better understanding
    of her works of art, as well as the creative individual behind them.
